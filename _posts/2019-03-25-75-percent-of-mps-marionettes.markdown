If you look closely you’ll find that at least 75% of MP's are marionettes.

This was brought to light by my cat last night at the full moon; it is of vital importance that we replace them at onece! A marionette is a puppet controlled from above using wires or strings depending on regional variations. A marionette's puppeteer is called a marionettist. 

Who is this marionettist? What do they want? Why does my cat know them?

Wiskers infomed me that he found out about the MP's by when their strings got tangled last night in parliment. They all blinked their left eye when the PM stood up, sugesting that she is under their controll as well!
